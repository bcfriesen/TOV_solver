This program calculates the pressure P and total mass M as a function of
radius r in a spherically symmetric, static mass, in the context of general
relativity. The ODE for the pressure is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
(TOV) equation, whereas the mass ODE comes simply from mass conservation. Note
that M(r) is defined as the TOTAL mass included out to radius r, and thus must
be a monotonically increasing function in r.

The TOV equation + mass conservation lead to 2 ODEs (one for M(r) and the
other for P(r)), but in these equations we have a third variable, the matter
density \rho(r). Thus we close (and therefore are able to solve) the system
by providing some function \rho. In principle the equations are simplest to
solve if we know \rho(r), but I can't think of a single case where we would
know \rho(r) in a star ab initio. So instead we can provide \rho(P), which
is known in thermodynamics as an equation of state (EOS). This program uses
the latter. Specifically it uses a parameterized but not-completely-worthless
EOS called a "polytrope" which is a function which satisfies the Lane-Emden
differential equation and has the form

                           P(\rho) = K * (\rho)^\Gamma

where K and \Gamma are constants. For electron-degenerate matter (in white
dwarfs, e.g.) one can use \Gamma = 5/3. For neutron-degenerate matter (in
neutron stars), one can use \Gamma = 2. In this solver I have set K = 1 because
a.) it makes the calculation simpler and the numbers more reasonable, and b.) I
can put the units back at the end. I have also set G = c = 1 for the same
reason.

Given that the ODEs contain derivatives of P and M, we must supply the EOS in
the form of \rho = \rho(P). Typically an EOS is written the other way around:
P = P(\rho). However, because the ODEs are written such that P is being
integrated, not \rho, we must close the system using this unusual form. To
rewrite the ODEs such that \rho is being integrated, not P, would amount only
to a small bit of work; I just haven't done it yet. This case would be more
appropriate (read: standard) since most EOSs receive \rho as an argument and
return P, so if I wanted this program to play nicely with them I would have to
rewrite it as described above.

Among other things, this program can tell you how massive is a relativistic star
in hydrostatic equilibrium. To find this, just pick some final radius for the
integration and watch P(r) drop. The surface of the star R is at the radius
where P(r = R) = 0. Of course the integrator has no idea that P(r) can't be
negative, but the ODEs certainly do, and will result in lots of NaNs once the
integrator reaches the surface. So pick a large enough 'final' radius such
that P(r) at least reaches zero, and ignore everything past that point where
it goes negative/NaN. I find (in this weird unitless form) that R ~ 1.5.

Remember also that you need to specify P(r = 0) as an initial condition. By
construction M(r = 0) = 0 so that part's done. What's cool to do is fix \Gamma
and then vary P(r = 0) and watch the total mass vary with it. You should find
that there exists single P(r = 0) for which M(r = R) is maximized. For
\Gamma ~ 5/3 (a WD) that value should be about ~1.4 M_solar, the famous
Chandrasekhar mass. For \Gamma ~ 2, it's something like ~0.7 M_solar, the
slightly less famous Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.
